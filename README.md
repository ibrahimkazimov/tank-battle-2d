# Boilerplate for 2D Multiplayer Tank Battle

A real-time multiplayer 2D tank battle game built with modern web technologies. This version features a scalable monorepo architecture separating client, server, and shared logic.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Battle against other players in real-time.
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive WASD movement and mouse aiming.
- **Physics-based Gameplay**: Projectile collisions and tank movement handled by a shared physics engine.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on various screen sizes with fair viewport scaling.
- **Session System**: Create parties and invite friends via links.

## Tech Stack

This project is a monorepo managed with **npm workspaces**.

- **Client** (`packages/client`):
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - specialized build tool
  - [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) - 2D rendering engine
  - [Socket.io-client](https://socket.io/) - Real-time communication

- **Server** (`packages/server`):
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
  - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - WebSocket server
  - [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Dev server with live reload

- **Shared** (`packages/shared`):
  - Common game logic, constants, physics, and types shared between client and server.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7+ required for workspaces)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibrahimkazimov/tank-battle-2d.git
   cd tank-battle-2d
   ```

2. Install dependencies for all packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

The project uses npm workspaces to manage scripts from the root directory.

### Start the Client

Runs the Vite development server for the user interface.

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

_Access at `http://localhost:5173` (or port shown in terminal)_

### Start the Server

Runs the Node.js/Express backend with Nodemon.

```bash
npm run start:server
```

_Runs on port `3000` by default_

> **Note**: For multiplayer to work, both the client and server must be running.

## Building for Production

To build the client for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static assets in `packages/client/dist`. The server is configured to serve these static files.
